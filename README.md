# WMD
This is created for wearing mask detection. We have our paper "Hybrid Transfer Learning and Broad Learning System for Wearing Mask Detection In the COVID-19 Era" has been accepted by  "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation & Measurement" with DOI 10.1109/TIM.2021.3069844. 


Dataset: 

1、------WMD------
We create a dataset named wearing mask detection (WMD).  It can be downloaded by: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gfHD821Kej1ZSyM1BV-wLQ extract code：0gyw .

It includes 7804 images with a total number of 26403 wearing masks. It is divided into three parts:

Training set: 5410 images, with 17654 wearing masks

Validation set: 800 images, with 1936 wearing masks

Testing set: 1594 images, with 6813 wearing masks.

2、-----WMC-------

Wearing Mask Classification Dataset can be downloaded by： https://pan.baidu.com/s/1tLtt6CkHDj5ACI7g7EVi8Q  extract code: jb7y . 
It includes 19590 mask samples and 18555 background samples.
 
 
3、--------Face dataset-----

It includes 4054 images with a total number of 16216 faces.

Traiing set: 2407 images with 9368 faces

Validation set:  500 images  with  1798 faces 

Testing set:   1147 images with  5032 faces 

They can be downloaded by https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jtKyGP4KMzKKIvrRg-PJQg
