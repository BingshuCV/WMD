# WMD
This is created for wearing mask detection. We have our paper "Hybrid
Transfer Learning and Broad Learning System for Wearing Mask Detection In the COVID-19 Era", which is submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation & Measurement". 

Dataset: 

------WMD------
We create a dataset named wearing mask detection (WMD).  It can be downloaded by: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gfHD821Kej1ZSyM1BV-wLQ extract code：0gyw .

It includes 7804 images with a total number of 26403 wearing masks. It is divided into three parts:

Training set: 5410 images, with 17654 wearing masks

Validation set: 800 images, with 1936 wearing masks

Testing set: 1594 images, with 6813 wearing masks.

-----WMC-------
Wearing Mask Classification Dataset can be downloaded by： https://pan.baidu.com/s/1tLtt6CkHDj5ACI7g7EVi8Q  extract code: jb7y . 
It includes 19590 mask samples and 18555 background samples.
